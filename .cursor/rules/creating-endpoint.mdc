You are creating a new Moysklad endpoint.

You will be given the description of the data types and methods from the Moysklad documentation.

Your goal is to create these types and methods in TypeScript.

- For list methods, make sure to include my utility methods, such as `.all()`, `.size()`, and `.first()`.
- Write extensive JSDoc for both methods and types, as per the [jsdoc.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/jsdoc.mdc) rule.
