- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`
- commitlint rules: @.commitlintrc.json
e.g. body's lines must not be longer than 100 characters, etc

## Your task

Based on the above changes, think about the commit message and create a single git commit.
Never add "Generated by" or "Co-Authored-By" to the commit message.
